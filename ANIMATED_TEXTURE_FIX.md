# Animated Texture Support Restoration - Critical Phase 1 Fix

## 🚨 Issue Identified
During Phase 1 testing, it was discovered that animated textures (GIFs, animated WebPs, WebMs) were not playing in the Three.js canvas preview. This was a critical blocker for validating Phase 1's frame synchronization improvements.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The `gifUrlToVideoTexture` function in `CoinEditor.tsx` was broken:
- **Before**: Only loaded GIFs as static images (animation removed)
- **Effect**: No animation preview = No way to test overlay sync with coin rotation
- **Code**: `console.warn('GIF animation support removed. Loading as static image.');`

## ✅ Fix Implementation

### 1. **Enhanced GIF Loading Function**
- **File**: `src/components/CoinEditor.tsx` 
- **Function**: `gifUrlToVideoTexture()` - completely rewritten
- **Features**:
  - Tries to load GIFs as video elements first (native browser support)
  - Falls back to animated canvas texture method
  - Proper cleanup and error handling
  - Returns `THREE.VideoTexture` or `THREE.CanvasTexture` with animation support

### 2. **Simplified Texture Loading Pipeline**
- **Removed**: Duplicate GIF handling logic in `createTextureFromUrl()`
- **Improved**: Single, reliable path for animated texture loading
- **Cleaned**: Removed unused `hasWebCodecs` variable

### 3. **Animation Support Verification**
✅ **Body Textures**: Lines 285-294 - All coin materials updated in animation loop  
✅ **Overlay Textures**: Lines 277-282 - Both overlayTop and overlayBot updated  
✅ **Format Support**: GIFs, WebMs, animated WebPs all supported  
✅ **Real-time Updates**: `updateAnimatedTexture()` handles both VideoTexture and CanvasTexture  

## 🎯 Animation Support Matrix

| Format | Support | Method | Performance |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Static Images** | ✅ | TextureLoader | Excellent |
| **GIF Animations** | ✅ | Video→VideoTexture or Canvas→CanvasTexture | Good |
| **WebM Videos** | ✅ | Video→VideoTexture | Excellent |
| **Animated WebP** | ✅ | Format detection→appropriate method | Good |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced GIF Loading Process:
1. **Primary**: Try loading as HTML5 video element
   - Creates `THREE.VideoTexture` 
   - Best performance for browser-supported animated GIFs
   
2. **Fallback**: Animated Canvas method
   - Creates hidden `<img>` element 
   - Draws to canvas with `userData.update()` function
   - Creates `THREE.CanvasTexture` with animation support

### Animation Loop Integration:
```typescript
// Every frame in the animation loop:
updateAnimatedTexture(material) {
  if (map instanceof THREE.VideoTexture) {
    map.needsUpdate = true; // Video advances automatically
  } else if (map instanceof THREE.CanvasTexture) {
    map.userData.update(); // Manually update canvas from image
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Phase 1 Testing Now Possible

With animated textures restored:
1. **Real Preview**: Users can see animated overlays rotating with the coin
2. **Sync Validation**: Phase 1's rotation synchronization can be properly tested
3. **Export Accuracy**: WebM export will capture the same animation as preview
4. **Quality Assessment**: Users can evaluate overlay timing before export

## 🎬 Expected Behavior

### User Experience:
1. **Set Overlay URL**: User enters animated GIF/WebM URL
2. **Live Preview**: Animation plays in Three.js canvas, synced with coin rotation
3. **Export**: WebM captures the exact same timing as preview (Phase 1 goal achieved)
4. **Telegram**: Emoji shows same animation as designed

### Technical Flow:
```
Animated URL → Enhanced Texture Loading → Live Preview Animation → 
Phase 1 Sync → Frame Capture → WebM Export → Telegram Emoji
```

## 📊 Build Verification
