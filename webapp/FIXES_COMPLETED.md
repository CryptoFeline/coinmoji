# ✨ Coinmoji WebApp - LATEST IMPROVEMENTS

A modern, responsive React application for creating custom emoji from 3D coin designs, specifically built for Telegram Mini Apps.

## 🎯 LATEST FIXES (COMPLETED)

### ✅ 1. Flexible Canvas Layout
- **Removed**: Header and title (Telegram mini-app will provide header)
- **Improved**: Canvas now flexibly fits between editor button and footer buttons
- **Layout**: Editor button → Flexible 3D canvas → Footer buttons

### ✅ 2. Unified Light Design System
- **Colors**: Light gray shades with colored outlines only
- **Background**: Clean light gray (#f9fafb)
- **Borders**: Gray outlines with colored accents for active states
- **Elements**: Consistent border-2 styling throughout

### ✅ 3. Simplified UI Consistency
- **Settings Panel**: Streamlined with proper gray borders and minimal styling
- **Buttons**: Outline-style with colored borders (blue for primary, orange for secondary)
- **Toggles**: Clean design with colored active states
- **Forms**: Consistent input styling with gray borders

### ✅ 4. Body Texture Upload Feature
- **Added**: Optional body texture upload in settings
- **Position**: Located before metallic finish section as requested
- **Support**: Handles JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebM files
- **UV Mapping**: Proper texture wrapping similar to face textures

### ✅ 5. Fixed Animation Speed Control
- **Issue**: Animation speed changes weren't working
- **Fix**: Used ref to track rotation speed for real-time updates
- **Result**: Speed changes now work immediately when adjusted

### ✅ 6. Fixed Dual Image Positioning
- **Issue**: Second image was horizontally flipped in dual mode
- **Fix**: Removed horizontal flipping for dual overlay mode
- **Result**: Both images maintain proper orientation

### ✅ 7. Animated GIF/WebM Support
- **Detection**: Automatically detects .gif and .webm file extensions
- **Implementation**: Uses `<video>` element → `THREE.VideoTexture` for animations
- **Playback**: Loops continuously with proper video texture handling
- **Fallback**: Static images still use standard texture loader

## 🎨 NEW DESIGN SYSTEM

### Color Palette
```css
Background: #f9fafb (gray-50)
Elements: White backgrounds with gray-200 borders
Active States: Blue-500 borders and accents
Secondary: Orange-500 for create emoji button
Text: Gray-700 primary, Gray-500 secondary
```

### Layout Structure
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Open Coin Editor] Button       │ ← Full width, outline style
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│        Flexible Canvas          │ ← Takes all available space
│         (3D Coin)               │
│                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Download] │ [Create Emoji]     │ ← Two column layout
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Animation System
- **Real-time Updates**: Rotation speed changes instantly
- **Ref-based Tracking**: Uses `rotationSpeedRef` for live animation control
- **Smooth Transitions**: No lag between setting changes and visual updates

### Texture Loading
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies animated vs static files
- **Video Textures**: Proper THREE.VideoTexture implementation for GIF/WebM
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed texture loads
- **Performance**: Optimized texture application and disposal

### Body Texture System
- **UV Mapping**: Consistent with face texture mapping
- **Priority**: Body texture overrides color/gradient when applied
- **Cleanup**: Proper texture disposal when switching modes
- **Anisotropy**: Uses renderer's max anisotropy for crisp textures

### Dual Overlay Fix
- **Single Mode**: Same image on both sides (no flipping)
- **Dual Mode**: Each side gets its own image (no flipping)
- **Orientation**: Maintains proper image orientation in all modes

## 🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Testing Body Textures
```bash
# Try these sample texture URLs:
- Static: https://example.com/gold-texture.jpg
- Animated: https://example.com/sparkle.gif
- Video: https://example.com/metallic.webm
```

### Animation Speed Testing
1. Open settings panel
2. Change from "Medium" to "Fast" 
3. See immediate rotation speed increase
4. Works for all three speeds

### Dual Image Setup
1. Toggle "Different Images" ON
2. Add front image URL
3. Add back image URL  
4. Both images maintain proper orientation

## 📱 MOBILE EXPERIENCE

### Touch Optimization
- **Target Size**: All interactive elements ≥44px
- **Spacing**: Proper spacing between touch targets
- **Feedback**: Visual feedback for all interactions
- **Scrolling**: Smooth panel scrolling with momentum

### Layout Responsiveness
- **Flexible Canvas**: Adapts to any screen height
- **Panel**: Dropdown doesn't cover canvas
- **Buttons**: Equal width distribution
- **Safe Areas**: Proper iOS safe area handling

## 🎯 TELEGRAM INTEGRATION

### Header Removal
- **Rationale**: Telegram mini-app provides its own header
- **Result**: More screen space for 3D canvas
- **Navigation**: Relies on Telegram's back button

### Theme Adaptation
- **Light Mode**: Clean, minimal design
- **Consistency**: Matches Telegram's design language
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices
